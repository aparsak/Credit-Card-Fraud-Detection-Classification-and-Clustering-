# üí≥ CreditCardFraudAI

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for detecting credit card fraud using both classification and clustering techniques. The project is specifically designed to handle unbalanced datasets, a common issue in fraud detection tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis, aimed at building robust fraud detection systems.

## üìä Project Overview
The project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and addressing class imbalance in the credit card transaction data.
- **Classification**: Using supervised learning techniques to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Clustering**: Applying unsupervised learning methods to detect anomalies in transaction patterns.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with a focus on handling imbalanced classes.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Data Preparation**: Includes scripts for cleaning, normalizing, and balancing the dataset using techniques such as SMOTE or undersampling.
- **Classification Models**: Implements various classification algorithms to handle class imbalance.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Applies clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN to identify potential frauds.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, which are particularly important in unbalanced datasets.
